# Prova Chain Design

## Summary

The DMG blockchain is a Bitcoin-derived blockchain, custom-designed for the use case of safely digitizing and transacting a representation of an underlying physical asset, for example: gold vaulted by [The Royal Mint](http://www.royalmint.com/). Its reference implementation is based on a fork of [btcd](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd), which is written in Go.
